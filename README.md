Neighborhood Project
Created by Matthew Barker

Open index.html and you'll be greated with the homepage of the project. On the left you'll find the location panel, where five preselected locations are entered.
There are two buttons for each location, the named(IE "hr haven") button will open an infoWindow for the location and readjust the google map. The "X" button will permenantly remove the location from the map and the list.
In the middle of the google maps view, you'll have the search box that'll retrieve more nearby locations. Upon selection, they will be added to the list on the left. 
Lastly, clicking on the markers manually in the google maps view will also open information regarding the location. 

Google Maps API, Google Places API, and Foursquare API were used in the construction of this project. 

TODO: Pretty it up. Adjust some scaling for better multiplatform use.
